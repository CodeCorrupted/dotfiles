# Kitty Configuration

This is the default configuration of kitty with some little improvements:

- Personalized fonts.
- Detect hyperlinks and open them at one click.
- Personalized tab bar.
- And a cool icon of Artix.

## Installation

- [JetBrainsMono Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)

Clone this repo, and then:

```sh
# Install
sudo pacman -S --needed kitty

# Copy
cp -r dotfiles/kitty/ ~/.config
```

## Customize

The `kitty.conf` file just imports everything inside the `conf.d/` directory,
so you don't need to change anything inside of it.

Check out the [official documentation](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/conf/).
You'll notice that the files on `conf.d/` are divided as the sections of the
docs to make more easy to you customize it.

The `colors-kitty.conf` it's a file generated by `pywal`. You can change it as
you like, if you don't use `pywal`.
